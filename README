# Ubuntu Focal - Fix for UHD panel

This branch has the patch from https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/272#note_335804
applied.

Assuming you have Ubuntu Focal 20.04, it is easy to compile your kernel and install it.
Flickering gone!

Dependencies:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev flex bison openssl libssl-dev dkms libelf-dev libudev-dev libpci-dev libiberty-dev autoconf default-jdk libcap-dev kernel-wedge linux-tools-common 
```

Clone this repo, which should create a folder `ubuntu-focal`. Then:

```shell
$ cd ubuntu-focal
$ LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules clean
$ LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic binary-perarch
```

This is going to create several `*.deb` in `../ubuntu-focal`.
```shell
$ ls *.deb
linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-40-generic_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
linux-cloud-tools-5.4.0-40_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
linux-cloud-tools-5.4.0-40-generic_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
linux-headers-5.4.0-40_5.4.0-40.44_all.deb
linux-headers-5.4.0-40-generic_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-generic_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
linux-modules-5.4.0-40-generic_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
linux-modules-extra-5.4.0-40-generic_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
linux-tools-5.4.0-40_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
linux-tools-5.4.0-40-generic_5.4.0-40.44_amd64.deb
```

Install them with:
```shell
$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

Make sure all went well with the installation. Reboot and start your new flickering free kernel.
```shell
$ uname -a            
Linux cartwheel 5.4.0-40-generic #44 SMP Fri Jun 26 16:41:30 CEST 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
